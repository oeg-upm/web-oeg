		<summary type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For managing geographic information catalogs in a joint way, it is desirable to have a single classification to cover the four classifications proposed by different sources of information. The result of the collaboration between both entities is a knowledge structure consisting of an events ontology, called PhenomenOntology (which various versions have been already produced during this collaboration), and a set of mappings between the ontology and the corresponding tables of the entity-relationship models of the gazetteers and cartographic Numeric bases of the IGN. The mappings discovery techniques were all integrated in the implementation MapDiscover, achieving the goal of generating mappings easily by inexperienced users.&lt;/p&gt;
