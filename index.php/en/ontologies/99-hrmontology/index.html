<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ontology described in this section  will act as a common "language" in the form of a set of controlled  vocabularies to describe the details of a job posting and the CV of a  job seeker. The ontology was developed following the NeOn Methodology  for Building Ontology Networks and with the ontology engineering tools  WSMT and WebODE. The ontology is composed of thirteen modular  ontologies: Competence, Compensation, Driving License, Economic  Activity, Education, Geography, Job Offer, Job Seeker, Labour  Regulatory, Language, Occupation, Skill and Time. The main subontologies  are the Job Offer and Job Seeker, which are intended to represent the  structure of a job posting and a CV respectively. While these two  subontologies were built taking as a starting point some HR-XML  recommendations, the other subontologies were derived from some  available international standards (like NACE, ISCO-88 (COM), FOET,  etc.), Employment Services classifications and international codes (like  ISO 3166, ISO 6392, etc.) that best fit the European requirements.The  figure below presents these thirteen modular ontologies (each ontology  is represented by a triangle). Ten of them were obtained after wrapping  the original format of the standard/classification, using ad hoc  translator or wrapper for each standard/classification.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="hrm-ontology" src="../../../../images/stories/hrm-ontology.png" height="442" width="650" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make possible the enrichment  of the standards, it was necessary to import them into the ontology  engineering tool WebODE. This process consisted in implementing the  necessary conversions mechanisms for transforming the standards into  WebODE's knowledge model. For this purpose we developed for each  standard/classification an ad hoc translator (wrapper) that transformed  all the data stored in external resources into WebODE's knowledge model.  Next, these standards/classifications can be exported into ontologies  expressed in WSML format by using an export utility of WebODE.<br /><br />Once  we transformed the standards into WSML ontologies, the next step was to  enrich them introducing concept attributes and ad hoc relationships  between ontology concepts of the same or different taxonomies. We  performed this task doing the following. We created from scratch the Job  Seeker Ontology (models the job seeker and his/her CV information), and  the Job Offer Ontology (models the job vacancy, job offer and employer  information) following some HR-XML recommendations. Moreover, we defined  relationships between the concepts of the Job Seeker and Job Offer  Ontologies and the concepts defined in the standard/classification based  ontologies.<br /><br />Next we provide the conceptualization of the mentioned ontologies.<br /><br /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li> <strong>Job Seeker Ontology</strong>. This ontology models  knowledge of job seeker and CV information used in the SEEMP Project.  The Job Seeker Ontology imports concepts from the education ontology,  language ontology, economic activity ontology, compensation ontology,  geography ontology, driving license ontology, labour regulatory ontology  and skill ontology, and these imported concepts are used to connect the  Job Seeker Ontology with the other ontologies. Examples of the  relationships can be: 'Job Seeker has driving license Driving License'  (with the Driving License concept from the Driving License Ontology),  'Job Seeker has education Education' (with the Education concept from  the Education Ontology), 'Job Seeker has mother tongue Language' (with  the Language concept from the Language Ontology), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Job Offer Ontology</strong>. This ontology models knowledge  of job vacancy, employer and job offer information used in the SEEMP  Project. The Job Offer Ontology imports concepts from the education  ontology, language ontology, economic activity ontology, compensation  ontology, geography ontology, driving license ontology, labour  regulatory ontology and skill ontology, and these imported concepts are  used to connect the Job Offer Ontology with the other ontologies.  Examples of the relationships can be: 'Job Vacancy requires driving  license Driving License' (with the Driving License concept from the  Driving License Ontology), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation Ontology</strong>. This ontology models  knowledge of wages and salaries used in the SEEMP Project. It is based  on the ISO 4217. The ISO 4217 is expressed in HTML format, and it is a  list of 254 currency names and codes. The resultant Compensation  Ontology has 2 concepts: Currency and Salary. For every currency element  specified in the ISO 4217 a different instance of the Currency concept  is defined. So, the Currency concept has 254 instances. An example  instance of the Currency concept is UNITED STATES - US Dollar. The ad  hoc relations defined in this ontology are has currency between the  Salary and Currency concepts, and its inverse one. The Currency concept  has the following instance attributes: Numeric code, Name, Entity and  Alphabetic Code.</li>
<li><strong>Driving License Ontology</strong>. This ontology models  knowledge of Driving License domain. It is based on the levels  recognized by the European Legislation. This classification is expressed  in HTML format and it is a list of 12 kinds of driving licenses. The  resultant Driving License Ontology just has the Driving License concept;  and for every kind of driving license specified in the European  Legislation a different instance of the Driving License concept is  defined. An example instance of the Driving License concept is A1 -  Light weight motorcycle. The Driving License concept has two relations:  'Driving License is associated with Job Vacancy' (with the Job Vacancy  concept from the Job Offer Ontology) and 'Driving License is driving  license of Job Seeker' (with the Job Seeker concept from the Job Seeker  Ontology).The Driving License concept has the following instance  attributes: Name and Description.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Activity Ontology</strong>. This ontology models  knowledge of economic activities and sectors. It is based on the NACE  Rev. 1.1 . This standard is expressed in MS Access database format and  it is a classification of 849 economic activities. The resultant  Economic Activity Ontology has 849 concepts. In this case we have  defined a concept for every element of the NACE taxonomy in order to  preserve the hierarchy. In the Economic Activity Ontology, the most  general concept is the Activity concept. This concept is organized in  the taxonomy based on the NACE. The Activity concept has four relations:  'Activity is associated with Objective' (with the Objective concept  from Job Seeker Ontology), 'Activity is associated with Offered Work  Experience' (with the Offered Work Experience concept from Job Seeker  Ontology), 'Activity is associated with Job Vacancy' (with the Job  Vacancy concept from Job Offer Ontology) and 'Activity is associated  with Requested Work Experience' (with the Requested Work Experience  concept from Job Offer Ontology).</li>
<li><strong>Occupation Ontology</strong>. This ontology models knowledge  of occupations and job categories. It is based on the ISCO-88 (COM).  ISCO-88 (COM) is expressed in MS Access database format. ISCO-88 (COM)  is a classification of 520 occupations. The resultant Occupation  Ontology has 520 concepts. In this case we have defined a concept for  every element of the ISCO taxonomy in order to preserve the hierarchy.  This ontology defines a concept taxonomy based on the aforementioned  standard, in which the most general concept is the Occupation concept.  The Occupation concept has four binary relations: 'Occupation is  associated with Objective' (with the Objective concept from the Job  Seeker Ontology), 'Occupation is associated with Offered Work  Experience' (with the Offered Work Experience concept from the Job  Seeker Ontology), 'Occupation is associated with Job Vacancy' (with the  Job Vacancy concept from the Job Offer Ontology) and 'Occupation is  associated with Requested Work Experience' (with the Requested Work  Experience concept from the Job Offer Ontology). The Occupation concept  has the following class attributes: Code, Description, Level and Name.</li>
<li><strong>Education Ontology</strong>. This ontology models knowledge  of education level and education fields. The education fields are based  on the FOET and the education levels are based on the ISCED97  (International Standard Classification of Education); both of them are  expressed in MS Access database format. FOET has 127 education fields  and ISCED97 has 7 education levels. The resultant Education Ontology has  130 concepts. For the education levels we have defined the Education  Level concept; and for every education level specified in ISCED97 a  different instance of the Education Level concept is defined. For the  education fields we have defined a concept for every element of the FOET  taxonomy in order to preserve the hierarchy. The ad hoc relations  specified for each concept are those relations whose domain is the  concept. For example, the concept Education has four binary relations:  'Education has education level Education Level', 'Education has  education field Education Field', 'Education is associated with Job  Vacancy' (with the Job Vacancy concept from the Job Offer Ontology) and  'Education is education of Job Seeker' (with the Job Seeker concept from  the Job Seeker Ontology). The Education Field concept has the following  class attributes: Code, Definition, Description, Excludes, Includes and  Level.</li>
<li><strong>Geography Ontology</strong>. This ontology is based on the  ISO 3166 country codes extended with continents and regions. The ISO  3166 is expressed in XML format; Continent and Region classifications  are stored in ORACLE database. The ISO 3166 has 244 country codes and  names; Region classification has 367 regions and Continent  classification has 9 continents. The resultant Geography Ontology has  four concepts, a Location as main concept, which is split into three  subclasses: Continent, Region and Country. For every country element  specified in the ISO 3166 a different instance of the Country concept is  defined, so the Country concept has 244 instances. For every region  element specified in the Region classification a different instance of  the Region concept is defined, so the Region concept has 367 regions.  Finally for every continent element specified in the Continent  classification a different instance of the Continent concept is defined.  An example instance of the Continent concept is EU - Europe. An example  instance of the Country concept is SPAIN - ES. An example instance of  the Region concept is Galicia. The Country concept has four binary  relations: 'Country is nation of Job Seeker' (with the Job Seeker  concept from the Job Seeker Ontology), 'Country is residence of Job  Seeker' (with the Job Seeker concept from the Job Seeker Ontology),  'Country is located in Continent' and 'Country has region Region'. The  Country concept has the following instance attributes: Name and Code.</li>
<li><strong>Labour Regulatory Ontology</strong>. This ontology is  inspired on some Employment Services classifications, ContracTypes and  WorkRuleTypes. ContractTypes classification has 10 contract types and  WorkRuleTypes has 9 work rule types. The resultant Labour Regulatory  Ontology has 2 concepts. For every type of work condition or contract  type considered, a different instance of one of these two concepts  (Contract Type or Work Condition) is included in the ontology. An  example instance of the Contract Type concept is Autonomous. An example  instance of the Work Condition concept is Partial time. The Work  Condition concept has 2 binary relations: 'Work Condition is associated  to Objective' (with the Objective concept from the Job Seeker Ontology)  and 'Work Condition is associated with Job Vacancy' (with the Job  Vacancy concept from the Job Offer Ontology). The Contract Type concept  has two binary relations: 'Contract Type is associated to Objective'  (with the Objective concept from the Job Seeker Ontology) and 'Contract  Type is associated with Job Vacancy' (with the Job Vacancy concept from  the Job Offer Ontology). The Contract Type has the following instance  attributes: Name and Description.</li>
<li><strong>Language Ontology</strong>. This ontology is based on the  ISO 6392 and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEF) . The ISO  6392 is expressed in HTML format and CEF is a description in PDF format.  The ISO 6392 has 490 language codes and CEF has 6 language levels. The  resultant Language Ontology has 3 concepts: Language, Language Level and  Language Proficiency. For every language element specified in the ISO  6392 a different instance of the Language concept is defined, so the  Language concept has 490 instances. For every language level element  specified in the CEF a different instance of the Language Level concept  is defined, so the Language Level concept has 6 instances. An example  instance of the Language concept is eng - English. An example instance  of the Language Level concept is A2 - Basic User. The Language concept  has three relations: 'Language is mother tongue of Job Seeker' (with the  Job Seeker concept from the Job Seeker Ontology), 'Language is spoken  by Job Seeker' (with the Job Seeker concept from the Job Seeker  Ontology) and 'Language is evaluated by Language Proficiency' (with the  Language Proficiency concept from the Language Ontology). The Language  concept has the following instance attributes: Name and Code.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Ontology</strong>. Mainly, this ontology models  knowledge of Information Technology (IT) Skills and Organisational  skills. It was built from scratch taking as reference the skills and  abilities requested by the IT employment market. This classification has  131 skills.</li>
<li><strong>Competence Ontology</strong>. This ontology defines a  concept called Competence as a super class of the imported concepts  Skill, Language Proficiency and Driving License. The ad hoc relations  specified for each concept are those relations whose domain is the  concept. The Competence concept has three binary relations: 'Competence  is associated with Vacancy' (with the Vacancy concept from the Job Offer  Ontology); 'Competence is competence of Candidacy' (with the Candidacy  concept from the Job Seeker Ontology) and 'Competence requires  Education' (with the Education concept from the Education Ontology).</li>
<li><strong>Time Ontology</strong>. This ontology is based on DAML  ontology, which is expressed in OWL format. The main concepts of this  ontology are Instant and Interval, which are subclasses of Temporal  Entity. Instant is linked to Interval through the properties of begins,  ends, inside and begins or in. Instant is also linked to an instant  temporal description, which is a concept with the properties of second,  minute, hour, day, month, year and time zone. Interval has the subclass  proper interval, which is related with itself through the relations  'interval equals', 'interval before', 'interval starts or finishes',  etc. Proper intervals can be concatenated through the relation  'concatenation'.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally we present the ontology  statistics. The ontology is composed of thirteen modular ontologies. The  ontology has 3206 concepts, 277 attributes, 1428 instances and 1592  axioms (most of them for setting class attribute values).</p></div><span class="article_separator">&nbsp;</span>
