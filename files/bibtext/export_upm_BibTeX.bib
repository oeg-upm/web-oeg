        abstract = {Reproducible research in scientic work ows is often addressed by tracking the provenance of the produced results. While this approach allows inspecting intermediate and nal results, improves understanding, and permits replaying a work ow execution, it does not ensure that the computational environment is available for subsequent executions to reproduce the experiment. In this work, we propose describing the resources involved in the execution of an experiment using a set of semantic vocabularies, so as to conserve the computational environment. We dene a process for documenting the work ow application, management system, and their dependencies based on 4 domain ontologies. We then conduct an experimental evaluation sing a real work ow application on an academic and a public Cloud platform. Results show that our approach can reproduce an equivalent execution environment of a predened virtual machine image on both computing platforms.}

Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are methods that help making better decisions when facing the complex problem of selecting the best solution among a group of alternatives that can be compared according to different conflicting criteria. In MCDM problems, alternatives represent concrete products, services or actions that will help in achieving a goal, while criteria represent the characteristics of these alternatives that are important for making a decision.}

In the specic case of in-silico scientic experiments, a large variety of scientic workflow systems (e.g., Wings, Taverna, Galaxy, Vistrails) have been created to support scientists. All of these systems produce some sort of provenance about the executions of the workflows that encode scientic experiments. However, provenance is normally recorded at a very low level of detail, which complicates the understanding of what happened during execution. In this paper we propose an approach to automatically obtain abstractions from low-level provenance data by finding common workflow fragments on workflow execution provenance and relating them to templates. We have tested our approach with a dataset of workflows published by the Wings workflow system. Our results show that by using these kinds of abstractions we can highlight the most common abstract methods used in the executions of a repository, relating different runs and workflow templates with each other.}

OPPL augments the ontologists? toolbox by providing a more efficient, and less error-prone, mechanism for enriching a biomedical ontology than that obtained by a manual treatment.

Results

We present OPPL-Galaxy, a wrapper for using OPPL within Galaxy. The functionality delivered by OPPL (i.e. automated ontology manipulation) can be combined with the tools and workflows devised within the Galaxy framework, resulting in an enhancement of OPPL. Use cases are provided in order to demonstrate OPPL-Galaxy?s capability for enriching, modifying and querying biomedical ontologies.

Conclusions

Coupling OPPL-Galaxy with other bioinformatics tools of the Galaxy framework results in a system that is more than the sum of its parts. OPPL-Galaxy opens a new dimension of analyses and exploitation of biomedical ontologies, including automated reasoning, paving the way towards advanced biological data analyses.}

Either through experience or intuition the reader will already know that the answer is with difficulty or not at all. In this paper we attempt to quantify this difficulty by reproducing a previously published paper for different classes of users (ranging from users with little expertise to domain experts) and suggest ways in which the situation might be improved. Quantification is achieved by estimating the time required to reproduce each of the steps in the method described in the original paper and make them part of an explicit workflow that reproduces the original results. Reproducing the method took several months of effort, and required using new versions and new software that posed challenges to reconstructing and validating the results. The quantification leads to ?reproducibility maps? that reveal that novice researchers would only be able to reproduce a few of the steps in the method, and that only expert researchers with advance knowledge of the domain would be able to reproduce the method in its entirety. The workflow itself is published as an online resource together with supporting software and data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the complexities of requiring reproducibility in terms of cost versus benefit, and a desiderata with our observations and guidelines for improving reproducibility. This has implications not only in reproducing the work of others from published papers, but reproducing work from one?s own laboratory.}

OWL ontologies were analysed on OOPS!?s 21 pitfalls, of which 24 ontologies were also examined manually

Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web with the idea of transforming it into a global graph. One of the crucial steps of this initiative is the linking step, in which datasets in one or more languages need to be linked or connected with one another. We claim that the linking process would be facilitated if datasets are enriched with lexical and terminological information. Being that the final aim, we propose a classification of lexical, terminological and semantic variants that will become part of a model of linguistic descriptions that is currently being proposed within the framework of the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group to enrich ontologies and Linked Data vocabularies. Examples of modeling solutions of the different types of variants are also provided.}

By pointing to ontologies, Semantic Web-based applications are able to inter-operate and share common information easily. Nevertheless, multilingual semantic applications are still rare, owing to the fact that most online ontologies are monolingual in English. In order to solve this issue, techniques for ontology localisation and translation are needed. However, traditional machine translation is difficult to apply to ontologies, owing to the fact that ontology labels tend to be quite short in length and linguistically different from the free text paradigm. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance machine translation of ontologies based on exploiting the well-structured concept descriptions contained in the ontology. In particular, our approach leverages the semantics contained in the ontology by using Cross Lingual Explicit Semantic Analysis (CLESA) for context-based disambiguation in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). The presented work is novel in the sense that application of CLESA in SMT has not been performed earlier to the best of our knowledge.}

The lack of control on the published sources, which could be untrustworthy or unreliable, along with their dynamic nature that often invalidates links and causes conflicts or other discrepancies, could lead to poor quality data. In order to judge data quality, a number of quality indicators have been proposed, coupled with quality metrics that quantify the ?quality level? of a dataset. In addition to the above, some approaches address how to improve the quality of the datasets through a repair process that focuses on how to correct invalidities caused by constraint violations by either removing or adding triples. In this paper we argue that provenance is a critical factor that should be taken into account during repairs to ensure that the most reliable data is kept. Based on this idea, we propose quality metrics that take into account provenance and evaluate their applicability as repair guidelines in a particular data fusion setting.}

Nevertheless, issues arise caused by the semantic heterogeneity that naturally happens on the Web, namely redundancy and ambiguity. For tackling these issues, we present an approach to discover and represent, in a non-redundant way, the intended meaning of words in Web applications, while taking into account the (often unstructured) context in which they appear. To that end, we have developed novel ontology matching, clustering, and disambiguation techniques.

This paper con-tributes to the ontology validation activity by proposing a web-based tool, called OOPS!, independent of any ontology development environment, for de-tecting anomalies in ontologies. This tool will help developers to improve on-tology quality by automatically detecting potential errors.}

1.	INTRODUCTION. LINGUISTIC TOOLS AND ANNOTATIONS: THEIR LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
Computational Linguistics is already a consolidated research area. It builds upon the results of other two major ones, namely Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering, and it aims at developing computational models of human language (or natural language, as it is termed in this area). Possibly, its most well-known applications are the different tools developed so far for processing human language, such as machine translation systems and speech recognizers or dictation programs.
These tools for processing human language are commonly referred to as linguistic tools. Apart from the examples mentioned above, there are also other types of linguistic tools that perhaps are not so well-known, but on which most of the other applications of Computational Linguistics are built. These other types of linguistic tools comprise POS taggers, natural language parsers and semantic taggers, amongst others. All of them can be termed linguistic annotation tools.
Linguistic annotation tools are important assets. In fact, POS and semantic taggers (and, to a lesser extent, also natural language parsers) have become critical resources for the computer applications that process natural language. Hence, any computer application that has to analyse a text automatically and ?intelligently? will include at least a module for POS tagging. The more an application needs to ?understand? the meaning of the text it processes, the more linguistic tools and/or modules it will incorporate and integrate.
However, linguistic annotation tools have still some limitations, which can be summarised as follows:
1.	Normally, they perform annotations only at a certain linguistic level (that is, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, etc.).
2.	They usually introduce a certain rate of errors and ambiguities when tagging. This error rate ranges from 10 percent up to 50 percent of the units annotated for unrestricted, general texts.
3.	Their annotations are most frequently formulated in terms of an annotation schema designed and implemented ad hoc.
A priori, it seems that the interoperation and the integration of several linguistic tools into an appropriate software architecture could most likely solve the limitations stated in (1). Besides, integrating several linguistic annotation tools and making them interoperate could also minimise the limitation stated in (2). Nevertheless, in the latter case, all these tools should produce annotations for a common level, which would have to be combined in order to correct their corresponding errors and inaccuracies. Yet, the limitation stated in (3) prevents both types of integration and interoperation from being easily achieved. 
In addition, most high-level annotation tools rely on other lower-level annotation tools and their outputs to generate their own ones. For example, sense-tagging tools (operating at the semantic level) often use POS taggers (operating at a lower level, i.e., the morphosyntactic) to identify the grammatical category of the word or lexical unit they are annotating. Accordingly, if a faulty or inaccurate low-level annotation tool is to be used by other higher-level one in its process, the errors and inaccuracies of the former should be minimised in advance. Otherwise, these errors and inaccuracies would be transferred to (and even magnified in) the annotations of the high-level annotation tool.
Therefore, it would be quite useful to find a way to
(i)	correct or, at least, reduce the errors and the inaccuracies of lower-level linguistic tools; 
(ii)	unify the annotation schemas of different linguistic annotation tools or, more generally speaking, make these tools (as well as their annotations) interoperate.
Clearly, solving (i) and (ii) should ease the automatic annotation of web pages by means of linguistic tools, and their transformation into Semantic Web pages (Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila, 2001). Yet, as stated above, (ii) is a type of interoperability problem. There again, ontologies (Gruber, 1993; Borst, 1997) have been successfully applied thus far to solve several interoperability problems. Hence, ontologies should help solve also the problems and limitations of linguistic annotation tools aforementioned.
Thus, to summarise, the main aim of the present work was to combine somehow these separated approaches, mechanisms and tools for annotation from Linguistics and Ontological Engineering (and the Semantic Web) in a sort of hybrid (linguistic and ontological) annotation model, suitable for both areas. This hybrid (semantic) annotation model should (a) benefit from the advances, models, techniques, mechanisms and tools of these two areas; (b) minimise (and even solve, when possible) some of the problems found in each of them; and (c) be suitable for the Semantic Web. The concrete goals that helped attain this aim are presented in the following section.
2.	GOALS OF THE PRESENT WORK
As mentioned above, the main goal of this work was to specify a hybrid (that is, linguistically-motivated and ontology-based) model of annotation suitable for the Semantic Web (i.e. it had to produce a semantic annotation of web page contents). This entailed that the tags included in the annotations of the model had to (1) represent linguistic concepts (or linguistic categories, as they are termed in ISO/DCR (2008)), in order for this model to be linguistically-motivated; (2) be ontological terms (i.e., use an ontological vocabulary), in order for the model to be ontology-based; and (3) be structured (linked) as a collection of ontology-based {\ensuremath{<}}Subject, Predicate, Object{\ensuremath{>}} triples, as in the usual Semantic Web languages (namely RDF(S) and OWL), in order for the model to be considered suitable for the Semantic Web.
Besides, to be useful for the Semantic Web, this model should provide a way to automate the annotation of web pages. As for the present work, this requirement involved reusing the linguistic annotation tools purchased by the OEG research group (http://www.oeg-upm.net), but solving beforehand (or, at least, minimising) some of their limitations. Therefore, this model had to minimise these limitations by means of the integration of several linguistic annotation tools into a common architecture. Since this integration required the interoperation of tools and their annotations, ontologies were proposed as the main technological component to make them effectively interoperate. From the very beginning, it seemed that the formalisation of the elements and the knowledge underlying linguistic annotations within an appropriate set of ontologies would be a great step forward towards the formulation of such a model (henceforth referred to as OntoTag).
Obviously, first, to combine the results of the linguistic annotation tools that operated at the same level, their annotation schemas had to be unified (or, preferably, standardised) in advance. This entailed the unification (id. standardisation) of their tags (both their representation and their meaning), and their format or syntax. Second, to merge the results of the linguistic annotation tools operating at different levels, their respective annotation schemas had to be (a) made interoperable and (b) integrated. And third, in order for the resulting annotations to suit the Semantic Web, they had to be specified by means of an ontology-based vocabulary, and structured by means of ontology-based {\ensuremath{<}}Subject, Predicate, Object{\ensuremath{>}} triples, as hinted above. Therefore, a new annotation scheme had to be devised, based both on ontologies and on this type of triples, which allowed for the combination and the integration of the annotations of any set of linguistic annotation tools. This annotation scheme was considered a fundamental part of the model proposed here, and its development was, accordingly, another major objective of the present work.
All these goals, aims and objectives could be re-stated more clearly as follows:
Goal 1:	Development of a set of ontologies for the formalisation of the linguistic knowledge relating linguistic annotation.
Sub-goal 1.1:	Ontological formalisation of the EAGLES (1996a; 1996b) de facto standards for morphosyntactic and syntactic annotation, in a way that helps respect the {\ensuremath{<}}Unit, Attribute, Value{\ensuremath{>}} triple structure recommended for annotations in these works (which is isomorphic to the {\ensuremath{<}}Subject, Predicate, Object{\ensuremath{>}} triple structures used in the context of the Semantic Web).
Sub-goal 1.2:	Incorporation into this preliminary ontological formalisation of other existing standards and standard proposals relating the levels mentioned above, such as those currently under development within ISO/TC 37 (the ISO Technical Committee dealing with Terminology, which deals also with linguistic resources and annotations).
Sub-goal 1.3:	Generalisation and extension of the recommendations in EAGLES (1996a; 1996b) and ISO/TC 37 to the semantic level, for which no ISO/TC 37 standards have been developed yet.
Sub-goal 1.4:	Ontological formalisation of the generalisations and/or extensions obtained in the previous sub-goal as generalisations and/or extensions of the corresponding ontology (or ontologies).
Sub-goal 1.5:	Ontological formalisation of the knowledge required to link, combine and unite the knowledge represented in the previously developed ontology (or ontologies).
Goal 2:	Development of OntoTag?s annotation scheme, a standard-based abstract scheme  for the hybrid (linguistically-motivated and ontological-based) annotation of texts.
Sub-goal 2.1:	Development of the standard-based morphosyntactic annotation level of OntoTag?s scheme. This level should include, and possibly extend, the recommendations of EAGLES (1996a) and also the recommendations included in the ISO/MAF (2008) standard draft.
Sub-goal 2.2:	Development of the standard-based syntactic annotation level of the hybrid abstract scheme. This level should include, and possibly extend, the recommendations of EAGLES (1996b) and the ISO/SynAF (2010) standard draft.
Sub-goal 2.3:	Development of the standard-based semantic annotation level of OntoTag?s (abstract) scheme.
Sub-goal 2.4:	Development of the mechanisms for a convenient integration of the three annotation levels already mentioned. These mechanisms should take into account the recommendations included in the ISO/LAF (2009) standard draft.
Goal 3:	Design of OntoTag?s (abstract) annotation architecture, an abstract architecture for the hybrid (semantic) annotation of texts (i) that facilitates the integration and interoperation of different linguistic annotation tools, and (ii) whose results comply with OntoTag?s annotation scheme.
Sub-goal 3.1:	Specification of the decanting processes that allow for the classification and separation, according to their corresponding levels, of the results of the linguistic tools annotating at several different levels.
Sub-goal 3.2:	Specification of the standardisation processes that allow (a) complying with the standardisation requirements of OntoTag?s annotation scheme, as well as (b) combining the results of those linguistic tools that share some level of annotation.
Sub-goal 3.3:	Specification of the merging processes that allow for the combination of the output annotations and the interoperation of those linguistic tools that share some level of annotation.
Sub-goal 3.4:	Specification of the merge processes that allow for the integration of the results and the interoperation of those tools performing their annotations at different levels.
Goal 4:	Generation of OntoTagger?s schema, a concrete instance of OntoTag?s abstract scheme for a concrete set of linguistic annotations. These linguistic annotations result from the tools and the resources available in the research group, namely 
?	Bitext?s DataLexica (http://www.bitext.com/EN/datalexica.asp),
?	LACELL?s (POS) tagger (http://www.um.es/grupos/grupo-lacell/quees.php),
?	Connexor?s FDG (http://www.connexor.eu/technology/machinese/glossary/fdg/), and
?	EuroWordNet (Vossen et al., 1998).
This schema should help evaluate OntoTag?s underlying hypotheses, stated below. Consequently, it should implement, at least, those levels of the abstract scheme dealing with the annotations of the set of tools considered in this implementation. This includes the morphosyntactic, the syntactic and the semantic levels.
Goal 5:	Implementation of OntoTagger?s configuration, a concrete instance of OntoTag?s abstract architecture for this set of linguistic tools and annotations. This configuration (1) had to use the schema generated in the previous goal; and (2) should help support or refute the hypotheses of this work as well (see the next section).
Sub-goal 5.1:	Implementation of the decanting processes that facilitate the classification and separation of the results of those linguistic resources that provide annotations at several different levels (on the one hand, LACELL?s tagger operates at the morphosyntactic level and, minimally, also at the semantic level; on the other hand, FDG operates at the morphosyntactic and the syntactic levels and, minimally, at the semantic level as well).
Sub-goal 5.2:	Implementation of the standardisation processes that allow (i) specifying the results of those linguistic tools that share some level of annotation according to the requirements of OntoTagger?s schema, as well as (ii) combining these shared level results. In particular, all the tools selected perform morphosyntactic annotations and they had to be conveniently combined by means of these processes.
Sub-goal 5.3:	Implementation of the merging processes that allow for the combination (and possibly the improvement) of the annotations and the interoperation of the tools that share some level of annotation (in particular, those relating the morphosyntactic level, as in the previous sub-goal).
Sub-goal 5.4:	Implementation of the merging processes that allow for the integration of the different standardised and combined annotations aforementioned, relating all the levels considered.
Sub-goal 5.5:	Improvement of the semantic level of this configuration by adding a named entity recognition, (sub-)classification and annotation subsystem, which also uses the named entities annotated to populate a domain ontology, in order to provide a concrete application of the present work in the two areas involved (the Semantic Web and Corpus Linguistics).

3.	MAIN RESULTS: ASSESSMENT OF ONTOTAG?S UNDERLYING HYPOTHESES
The model developed in the present thesis tries to shed some light on (i) whether linguistic annotation tools can effectively interoperate; (ii) whether their results can be combined and integrated; and, if they can, (iii) how they can, respectively, interoperate and be combined and integrated. Accordingly, several hypotheses had to be supported (or rejected) by the development of the OntoTag model and OntoTagger (its implementation).
The hypotheses underlying OntoTag are surveyed below. Only one of the hypotheses (H.6) was rejected; the other five could be confirmed.
H.1	The annotations of different levels (or layers) can be integrated into a sort of overall, comprehensive, multilayer and multilevel annotation, so that their elements can complement and refer to each other.
?	CONFIRMED by the development of:
o	OntoTag?s annotation scheme,
o	OntoTag?s annotation architecture,
o	OntoTagger?s (XML, RDF, OWL) annotation schemas,
o	OntoTagger?s configuration.
H.2	Tool-dependent annotations can be mapped onto a sort of tool-independent annotations and, thus, can be standardised.
?	CONFIRMED by means of the standardisation phase incorporated into OntoTag and OntoTagger for the annotations yielded by the tools.
H.3	Standardisation should ease:
H.3.1:	The interoperation of linguistic tools.
H.3.2:	The comparison, combination (at the same level and layer) and integration (at different levels or layers) of annotations.
?	H.3 was CONFIRMED by means of the development of OntoTagger?s ontology-based configuration:
o	Interoperation, comparison, combination and integration of the annotations of three different linguistic tools (Connexor?s FDG, Bitext?s DataLexica and LACELL?s tagger);
o	Integration of EuroWordNet-based, domain-ontology-based and named entity annotations at the semantic level.
o	Integration of morphosyntactic, syntactic and semantic annotations.
H.4	Ontologies and Semantic Web technologies (can) play a crucial role in the standardisation of linguistic annotations, by providing consensual vocabularies and standardised formats for annotation (e.g., RDF triples).
?	CONFIRMED by means of the development of OntoTagger?s RDF-triple-based annotation schemas.
H.5	The rate of errors introduced by a linguistic tool at a given level, when annotating, can be reduced automatically by contrasting and combining its results with the ones coming from other tools, operating at the same level. However, these other tools might be built following a different technological (stochastic vs. rule-based, for example) or theoretical (dependency vs. HPS-grammar-based, for instance) approach.
?	CONFIRMED by the results yielded by the evaluation of OntoTagger.
H.6	Each linguistic level can be managed and annotated independently.
?	REJECTED: OntoTagger?s experiments and the dependencies observed among the morphosyntactic annotations, and between them and the syntactic annotations.
In fact, Hypothesis H.6 was already rejected when OntoTag?s ontologies were developed. We observed then that several linguistic units stand on an interface between levels, belonging thereby to both of them (such as morphosyntactic units, which belong to both the morphological level and the syntactic level). Therefore, the annotations of these levels overlap and cannot be handled independently when merged into a unique multileveled annotation.

4.	OTHER MAIN RESULTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS 
First, interoperability is a hot topic for both the linguistic annotation community and the whole Computer Science field. The specification (and implementation) of OntoTag?s architecture for the combination and integration of linguistic (annotation) tools and annotations by means of ontologies shows a way to make these different linguistic annotation tools and annotations interoperate in practice.
Second, as mentioned above, the elements involved in linguistic annotation were formalised in a set (or network) of ontologies (OntoTag?s linguistic ontologies).
?	On the one hand, OntoTag?s network of ontologies consists of
?	The Linguistic Unit Ontology (LUO), which includes a mostly hierarchical formalisation of the different types of linguistic elements (i.e., units) identifiable in a written text;
?	The Linguistic Attribute Ontology (LAO), which includes also a mostly hierarchical formalisation of the different types of features that characterise the linguistic units included in the LUO;
?	The Linguistic Value Ontology (LVO), which includes the corresponding formalisation of the different values that the attributes in the LAO can take;
?	The OIO (OntoTag?s Integration Ontology), which
?	Includes the knowledge required to link, combine and unite the knowledge represented in the LUO, the LAO and the LVO;
?	Can be viewed as a knowledge representation ontology that describes the most elementary vocabulary used in the area of annotation.
?	On the other hand, OntoTag?s ontologies incorporate the knowledge included in the different standards and recommendations for linguistic annotation released so far, such as those developed within the EAGLES and the SIMPLE European projects or by the ISO/TC 37 committee:
?	As far as morphosyntactic annotations are concerned, OntoTag?s ontologies formalise the terms in the EAGLES (1996a) recommendations and their corresponding terms within the ISO Morphosyntactic Annotation Framework (ISO/MAF, 2008) standard;
?	As for syntactic annotations, OntoTag?s ontologies incorporate the terms in the EAGLES (1996b) recommendations and their corresponding terms within the ISO Syntactic Annotation Framework (ISO/SynAF, 2010) standard draft;
?	Regarding semantic annotations, OntoTag?s ontologies generalise and extend the recommendations in EAGLES (1996a; 1996b) and, since no stable standards or standard drafts have been released for semantic annotation by ISO/TC 37 yet, they incorporate the terms in SIMPLE (2000) instead;
?	The terms coming from all these recommendations and standards were supplemented by those within the ISO Data Category Registry (ISO/DCR, 2008)  and also of the ISO Linguistic Annotation Framework (ISO/LAF, 2009) standard draft when developing OntoTag?s ontologies.
Third, we showed that the combination of the results of tools annotating at the same level can yield better results (both in precision and in recall) than each tool separately. In particular,
1.	OntoTagger clearly outperformed two of the tools integrated into its configuration, namely DataLexica and FDG in all the combination sub-phases in which they overlapped (i.e. POS tagging, lemma annotation and morphological feature annotation). As far as the remaining tool is concerned, i.e. LACELL?s tagger, it was also outperformed by OntoTagger in POS tagging and lemma annotation, and it did not behave better than OntoTagger in the morphological feature annotation layer.
2.	As an immediate result, this implies that
a)	This type of combination architecture configurations can be applied in order to improve significantly the accuracy of linguistic annotations; and
b)	Concerning the morphosyntactic level, this could be regarded as a way of constructing more robust and more accurate POS tagging systems.
Fourth, Semantic Web annotations are usually performed by humans or else by machine learning systems. Both of them leave much to be desired: the former, with respect to their annotation rate; the latter, with respect to their (average) precision and recall. In this work, we showed how linguistic tools can be wrapped in order to annotate automatically Semantic Web pages using ontologies. This entails their fast, robust and accurate semantic annotation.
As a way of example, as mentioned in Sub-goal 5.5, we developed a particular OntoTagger module for the recognition, classification and labelling of named entities, according to the MUC and ACE tagsets (Chinchor, 1997; Doddington et al., 2004). These tagsets were further specified by means of a domain ontology, namely the Cinema Named Entities Ontology (CNEO). This module was applied to the automatic annotation of ten different web pages containing cinema reviews (that is, around 5000 words). In addition, the named entities annotated with this module were also labelled as instances (or individuals) of the classes included in the CNEO and, then, were used to populate this domain ontology.
?	The statistical results obtained from the evaluation of this particular module of OntoTagger can be summarised as follows. On the one hand, as far as recall (R) is concerned, (R.1) the lowest value was 76,40\% (for file 7); (R.2) the highest value was 97, 50\% (for file 3); and (R.3) the average value was 88,73\%. On the other hand, as far as the precision rate (P) is concerned, (P.1) its minimum was 93,75\% (for file 4); (R.2) its maximum was 100\% (for files 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10); and (R.3) its average value was 98,99\%.
?	These results, which apply to the tasks of named entity annotation and ontology population, are extraordinary good for both of them.  They can be explained on the basis of the high accuracy of the annotations provided by OntoTagger at the lower levels (mainly at the morphosyntactic level). However, they should be conveniently qualified, since they might be too domain- and/or language-dependent. It should be further experimented how our approach works in a different domain or a different language, such as French, English, or German.
?	In any case, the results of this application of Human Language Technologies to Ontology Population (and, accordingly, to Ontological Engineering) seem very promising and encouraging in order for these two areas to collaborate and complement each other in the area of semantic annotation.
Fifth, as shown in the State of the Art of this work, there are different approaches and models for the semantic annotation of texts, but all of them focus on a particular view of the semantic level. Clearly, all these approaches and models should be integrated in order to bear a coherent and joint semantic annotation level. OntoTag shows how (i) these semantic annotation layers could be integrated together; and (ii) they could be integrated with the annotations associated to other annotation levels.
Sixth, we identified some recommendations, best practices and lessons learned for annotation standardisation, interoperation and merge. They show how standardisation (via ontologies, in this case) enables the combination, integration and interoperation of different linguistic tools and their annotations into a multilayered (or multileveled) linguistic annotation, which is one of the hot topics in the area of Linguistic Annotation.
And last but not least, OntoTag?s annotation scheme and OntoTagger?s annotation schemas show a way to formalise and annotate coherently and uniformly the different units and features associated to the different levels and layers of linguistic annotation. This is a great scientific step ahead towards the global standardisation of this area, which is the aim of ISO/TC 37 (in particular, Subcommittee 4, dealing with the standardisation of linguistic annotations and resources).}

In this paper we present a general method for publishing Linked Data and the application of the method to cover di?erent sources from di?erent domains.}

This growth has been stimulated to a large extent by the emergence of Linked Data. Although this brings us a big step closer to the vision of a Semantic Web, it also raises new issues such as the need for dealing with information expressed in different natural languages. Indeed, although the Web of Data can contain any kind of information in any language, it still lacks explicit mechanisms to automatically reconcile such information when it is expressed in different languages. This leads to situations in which data expressed in a certain language is not easily accessible to speakers of other languages. The Web of Data shows the potential for being extended to a truly multilingual web as vocabularies and data can be published in a language-independent fashion, while associated language-dependent (linguistic) information supporting the access across languages can be stored separately. In this sense, the multilingual Web of Data can be realized in our view as a layer of services and resources on top of the existing Linked Data infrastructure adding i) linguistic information for data and vocabularies in different languages, ii) mappings between data with labels in different languages, and iii) services to dynamically access and traverse Linked Data across different languages. In this article we present this vision of a multilingual Web of Data. We discuss challenges that need to be addressed to make this vision come true and discuss the role that techniques such as ontology localization, ontology mapping, and cross-lingual ontology-based information access and presentation will play in achieving this. Further, we propose an initial architecture and describe a roadmap that can provide a basis for the implementation of this vision.}

This requirement has a strict binding for software tools that can support some interoperability levels, yet they can be hindered by a lack of shared models and vocabularies describing the resources to be handled, as well as the ways of handling them. Here, three examples of metalevel vocabularies are proposed, each covering at least one peculiar interoperability aspect: OMV for modeling the artifacts themselves, LIR for managing a multilingual layer on top of them, and C-ODO Light for modeling collaboration-supportive life cycle management tasks and processes. All of these models lend themselves to handling by dedicated software tools and are all being employed within NeOn products.}

One of the most important aspects of ?Lexical Linked Data? is the sharing of lexica and machine readable dictionaries. It is for this reason, that the lemon format has been proposed, which we briefly describe. We then consider two resources that seem ideal candidates for the Linked Data cloud, namely WordNet 3.0 and Wiktionary, a large document based dictionary. We discuss the challenges of converting both resources to lemon , and in particular for Wiktionary, the challenge of processing the mark-up, and handling inconsistencies and underspecification in the source material. Finally, we turn to the task of creating links between the two resources and present a novel algorithm for linking lexica as lexical Linked Data.}

In addition, the NeOn Methodology framework provides (a) a glossary of processes and activities involved in the development of ontologies, (b) two ontology life cycle models, and (c) a set of methodological guidelines for different processes and activities, which are described (a) functionally, in terms of goals, inputs, outputs, and relevant constraints; (b) procedurally, by means of workflow specifications; and (c) empirically, through a set of illustrative examples.}

Hence, there is a need for practical methodologies and technologies, which can assist a variety of user types with ontology development tasks. To address this need, this book presents a scenario-based methodology, the NeOn Methodology, which provides guidance for all main activities in ontology engineering. The context in which we consider these activities is that of a networked world, where reuse of existing resources is commonplace, ontologies are developed collaboratively, and managing relationships between ontologies becomes an essential aspect of the ontological engineering process. The description of both the methodology and the ontology engineering activities is grounded in a comprehensive software environment, the NeOn Toolkit and its plugins, which provides integrated support for all the activities described in the book. Here we provide an introduction for the whole book, while the rest of the content is organized into 4 parts: (1) the NeOn Methodology Framework, (2) the set of ontology engineering activities, (3) the NeOn Toolkit and plugins, and (4) three use cases. Primary goals of this book are (a) to disseminate the results from the NeOn project in a structured and comprehensive form, (b) to make it easier for students and practitioners to adopt ontology engineering methods and tools, and (c) to provide a textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate courses on ontology engineering.}

Domain ontologies can be used for different purposes, one of them is the development of semantic search engines that obtain precise results by considering the meaning of the Web content. The construction of these ontologies usually requires a large amount of effort and time to be completed. One way of reducing such effort and time is using the reuse approach. When ontologies overlap, alignment techniques to merge such ontologies can be applied. However, the result of the ontology merging activity can be a very large ontology, difficult to understand and use. To overcome this problem, this paper describes a methodology, called CreaDO, to semi-automatically create domain ontologies. CreaDO focuses on performing a parameter-based ontology merge that allows the creation of a domain ontology only with relevant information for the ontology purpose.}

For these reasons, several models have been proposed recently to enable richer linguistic descriptions in ontologies. Among them, we nd lemon, an RDF ontology-lexicon model that denes specic modules for dierent types of linguistic descriptions. In this contribution we propose a new module to represent translation relations between lexicons in dierent natural languages associated to the same ontology or belonging to dierent ontologies. This module can enable the representation of dierent types of translation relations, as well as translation metadata such as provenance or the reliability score of translations.}

Ontology Engineering refers to the set of activities that concern the ontology development process and the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them. Thanks to the work done in the Ontology Engineering field, the development of ontologies within and between teams has increased and improved, as well as the possibility of reusing ontologies in other developments and in final applications. Currently, ontologies are widely used in (a) Knowledge Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, (b) applications related to knowledge management, natural language processing, e-commerce, intelligent information integration, information retrieval, database design and integration, bio-informatics, education, and (c) the Semantic Web, the Semantic Grid, and the Linked Data initiative.

For these applications, the sensor readings need to be put in context by integrating them with other sources of data aboutthe surrounding environment. Traditional systems for predicting and detecting floods rely on methods that need significant human resources. In this paper we describe a semantic sensor web architecture for integrating multiple heterogeneous datasets, including live and historic sensor data, databases, and map layers. The architecture provides mechanisms for discovering datasets, defining integrated views over them, continuously receiving data in real-time, and visualising on screen and interacting with the data. Our approach makes extensive use of web service standards for querying and accessing data, and semantic technologies to discover and integrate datasets. We demonstrate the use of our semantic sensor web architecture in the context of a flood response planning web application that uses data from sensor networks monitoring the sea-state around the coast of England.}

One important component in software evaluation is the software quality model, since it provides the basis for software evaluation and gives a better insight of the software characteristics that influence its quality. Furthermore, quality models also ensure a consistent terminology for software product quality and provide guidance for its measurement.
In recent years, semantic technologies have started to gain importance and, as the field becomes more and more popular, the number of these technologies is increasing exponentially. Just as with any other software product, the quality of semantic technologies is an important concern, and multiple evaluations of semantic technologies have been performed. However, the problem is that there is no consistent terminology for describing the quality of semantic technologies and it is difficult to compare them because of differences in the meaning of the evaluation characteristics used. Also, existing software quality models do not define those quality characteristics that are specific to semantic technologies. 
This thesis presents a quality model for semantic technologies which aims to provide a common ground in the field of semantic technology evaluation. It also presents a new method for extending software quality models, based on a bottom-up approach, that is used to define the quality model for semantic technologies. Finally, this thesis describes the use of the semantic technology quality model in a web application that visualizes semantic technology evaluation results and provides semantic technology recommendations.}

image tagging information when this is available to calculate semantic relatedness between instances and candidate images. We performed experiments with focus on the particularly challenging problem of highly ambiguous names. Both methods presented in this work outperformed the baseline. Our best method leveraged context words from Wikipedia,tags from Flickr and type information from DBpedia to achieve an average precision of 80\%.}

However, in large-scale deployments it becomes hard to eectively exploit the data captured by the sensors, since there is no precise information about what devices are available and what properties they measure. Even when metadata is available, users need to know low-level details such as database schemas or names of properties that are specic to a device or platform. Therefore the task of coherently searching, correlating and combining sensor data becomes very challenging. We propose an ontology-based approach, that consists in exposing sensor observations in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic metadata, providing information such as: which sensor recorded what, where, when, and in which conditions. For this, we allow dening virtual semantic streams, whose ontological terms are related to the underlying sensor data schemas through declarative mappings, and can be queried in terms of a high level sensor network ontology.}

This growth has been stimulated to a large extent by the emergence of Linked Data. Although this brings us a big step closer to the vision of a Semantic Web, it also raises new issues such as the need for dealing with information expressed in different natural languages. Indeed, although the Web of Data can contain any kind of information in any language, it still lacks explicit mechanisms to automatically reconcile such information when it is expressed in ifferent languages. This leads to situations in which data expressed in a certain language is not easily accessible to speakers of other languages.
The Web of Data shows the potential for being extended to a truly multilingual web as vocabularies and data can be published in a language-independent fashion, while associated language-dependent (linguistic) information supporting the access across languages can be stored separately. In this sense, the multilingual Web of Data can be realized in our view as a layer of services and resources on top of the existing Linked Data infrastructure adding i) linguistic information for data and vocabularies in different languages, ii) mappings between data with labels in different languages, and iii) services to dynamically access and traverse Linked Data across different languages.
In this article we present this vision of a multilingual Web of Data. We discuss challenges that need to be addressed to make this vision come true and discuss the role that techniques such as ontology localization, ontology mapping, and cross-lingual ontology-based information access and presentation will play in achieving this. Further, we propose an initial architecture and describe a roadmap that can provide a basis for the implementation of this vision.}

In the latter, existing RDB2RDF systems do not normally perform such inferences at query time. This paper shows how the algorithm used in the REQUIEM system, focused on handling run-time inferences for query answering, can be adapted to handle such inferences for query answering in combination with RDB2RDF systems.}

Abstract  The main objective of this PhD thesis focuses on the ontology-based integration of information related to geospatial heterogeneous databases with the purpose of providing an integrated view of the stored information into different datasets.  Nowadays, there are different proposals for ontology-based integration information. Nevertheless, there is not a methodology that might be applied to the geographical information realm. This issue involves, at least, four important limitations in information integration processing:  The existing proposals are not easily replicable.  It is not easy to understand the characteristics of the approaches proposed.  The integration scenarios are restricted to similar datasets, use cases, and problems.  Planification tasks do not perform in a right way.   These limitations prove that there exists a need for a methodological approach to face the ontology-based integration of geospatial heterogeneous information. In this sense, this work proposes the following contributions:  Firstly, we have provided a methodological approach for ontology-based integration of geospatial information. This approach has been applied to a use case in the hydrographical information context.  Besides, we have developed several domain and multilingual ontological resources in the hydrographical realm. These resources have been used for generating seven RDF datasets, which include geometrical characteristics as a particular trait of geospatial data.  Moreover, we have published the Spanish hydrographical information according to the Linked Data principles. This initiative contributes to enrich the Web of Data with geospatial data in the Spanish language.  Finally, we have provided different heuristic approaches for discovering duplicate instances into heterogeneous RDF datasets.  The validity of these contributions has been supported by a use case (hydrographical information) and by a set of experiments performs. The obtained results reveal the applicability of the methodological approach and the feasibility of models (ontologies) and techniques (heuristic approaches). }

        abstract = {This thesis is focused on the reuse and possible subsequent re-engineering of knowledge resources, as opposed to custom-building new ontologies from scratch. The deep analysis of the state of the art has revealed that there are some methods and tools in the literature for transforming non-ontological resources into ontologies, but with some limitations: \_ Most of the methods presented are based on ad-hoc transformations for the resource type, and the resource implementation. \_ Only a few take advantage of the resource data model, an important artifact for the re-engineering process [GGPSFVT08]. \_ There is no any integrated framework, method or corresponding tool, that considers the resources types, data models and implementations identified in an unified way. \_ With regard to the transformation approach, the majority of the methods perform a TBox transformation, many others perform an ABox transformation and some perform a population. However, no method includes the possibility to perform the three transformation approaches. \_ Regarding to the degree of automation, almost all the methods perform a semi-automatic transformation of the resource. \_ According to the explicitation of the hidden semantics in the relations of the resource components, we can state that the methods that perform a TBox transformation make explicit the semantics in the relations of the resource components. Most of those methods identify subClassOf relations, others identify ad-hoc relations, and some identify partOf relations. However, only a few methods make explicit the three types of relations. \_ With respect to how the methods make explicit the hidden semantics in the relations of the resource terms, we can say that three methods rely on the domain expert for making explicit the semantics, and two rely on an external resource, e.g., DOLCE ontology. Moreover, there are two methods that rely on external resources but not for making explicit the hidden semantics, but for finding out a proper ontology for populating it. \_ According to the provision of the methodological guidelines, almost all the methods provide methodological guidelines for the transformation. However these guidelines are not finely detailed; for instance, they do not provide information about who is in charge of performing a particular activity/task, nor when that activity/task has to be carried out. \_ With regard to the techniques employed, most of the methods do not mention them at all. Only a few methods specify techniques as transformation rules, lexico-syntactic patterns, mapping rules and natural language techniques. In this thesis we have provided a method and its technological support that rely on re-engineering patterns in order to speed up the ontology development process by reusing and re-engineering as much as possible available non-ontological resources. To achieve this overall goal, we have decomposed it in the following objectives: (1) the definition of methodological aspects related with the reuse of non-ontolo-gical resource for building ontologies; (2) the definition of methodological aspects related with the re-engineering of non-ontological resources for building ontologies; (3) the creation of a library of patterns for re-engineering nonontological resources into ontologies; and (4) the development of a software library that implements the suggestions given by the re-engineering patterns. Having in mind these goals, in this chapter we present how the open research problems identified in Chapter 2 are solved by the main thesis contributions. Then, we discuss the verification of our hypotheses, and finally we provide an outlook for the future work in those topics.}

The Melting Point is a methodology engineered for decentralised communities of practice for which the designers of technology and the users may be the same group. As such, MP provides a potential foundation for the establishment of standard practices for ontology engineering.}

This paper describes how semantic grounding techniques can be used during the creation of qualitative reasoning models, to bridge the gap between the imprecise user terminology and a well defined external common vocabulary. We also explore the application of ontology matching techniques between models, which can provide valuable feedback during the model construction process.}

In addition, the existence of detailed examples of real use cases that reuse ODPs favours the adoption and application of such methods. Thus, our objective in this paper is to show an example of how to apply a method for reusing ODPs during the development of a context ontology network to model context-related knowledge that allows adapting applications based on user context. Besides, in this paper we present the main drawbacks found during the application of the reuse method as well as some proposals to overcome them.}

One of the most critical steps in this task aims at transferring knowledge from SMEs? expertise to formal, machine-readable representations, which allow systems to reason with such knowledge. However, this process is costly and error prone. Alleviating such knowledge acquisition bottleneck requires enabling SMEs with the means to produce the target knowledge representations, minimizing the intervention of KEs. This is especially difficult in the case of complex knowledge types like processes. The analysis of scientific domains like Biology, Chemistry, and Physics uncovers: (i) that process knowledge is the single most frequent type of knowledge occurring in such domains and (ii) specific solutions need to be devised in order to allow SMEs to represent it in a computational form. We present a framework and computer system for the acquisition and representation of process knowledge in scientific domains by SMEs. We propose methods and techniques to enable SMEs to acquire process knowledge from the domains, to formally represent it, and to reason about it. We have developed an abstract process metamodel and a library of problem solving methods (PSMs), which support these tasks, respectively providing the terminology for SME-tailored process diagrams and an abstract formalization of the strategies needed for reasoning about processes. We have implemented this approach as part of the DarkMatter system and formally evaluated it in the context of the intermediate evaluation of Project Halo, an initiative aiming at the creation of question answering systems by SMEs.}

These two products will serve in the ontology development in two ways: (a) to avoid the appearance of pitfalls in the ontology modelling, and (b) to evaluate and correct ontologies to improve their quality.}

Web application developers incorporate those templates into their web applications, by means of a simple mechanism based in HTTP messages. End-users can use these templates through a Google Gadget.

With the aim of showing how external models can cater for cultural discrepancies, we compare two versions of an ontology of the hydrographical domain: hydrOntology. The first version makes use of the labeling system supported by RDF(S) and OWL to include multilingual linguistic information in the ontology. The second version relies on the Linguistic Information Repository model (LIR) to associate structured multilingual information to ontology concepts.

These experiments show a good balance between the usability of the applications created with this framework and the effort and skills required by developers.}

These two challenges are addressed by a Metadata Cache that works with an update-on-demand policy and by an information source selection module that selects the most suitable source at a given point in time. We have evaluated the quality of this information service, and compared it with other similar services from the EGEE production testbed, with promising results.}

defined as solutions to ontological design problems, are of great help to
developers when modelling ontologies since these patterns provide a
development guide and improve the quality of the resulting ontologies.
However, it has been demonstrated that, in many cases, developers encounter
difficulties when they have to reuse the correct design patterns and include
errors in the modelling. Thus, to avoid pitfalls in ontology modelling, this paper
proposes classifying errors into two types: (1) errors related to existing ODPs,
called anti-patterns, and (2) errors not related to existing ODPs, called pitfalls.
This classification is the result of analysing a set of ontologies. This paper is
focused on the pitfalls identified during the analysis. In addition the paper
presents a classification of the pitfalls found and a set of pitfall examples.}

LSPs will permit novice  users the conversion of the domain field they want to model into an ontological  structure. In the present contribution,  the language of classification in Spanish  is studied in order to collect the most common ways of verbally expressing the  subclassOf relation. Then, the topology of the most common classification  patterns is analysed to discover the type of ontological knowledge provided, i.e.  which concept relation, and the two essential features in ontology knowledge:  exhaustiveness and disjointness.}

To reduce that barrier, many efforts have gone in the creation of Controlled Languages (CL) translatable into ontology structures. However, CLs fall short of addressing a more profound problem: the selection of the most appropriate ontology modelling component for a certain modelling problem, regardless of the underlying representation paradigm. With the aim of approaching non ontology expert's difficulties in selecting the most appropriate modelling solution, we propose a Natural Language (NL) guided approach based on a repository of Lexico-Syntactic Patterns associated to consensual modelling solutions, i.e., Ontology Design Patterns. By relying on this repository, untrained users can formulate in NL what they want to model in the ontology, and obtain the corresponding design pattern for the modelling issue.}

In practice, such heterogeneity causes the building up of multiple sets of geodata with different underlying models and schemas that have different structure and semantics. Ontologies are a proposal widely used for solving heterogeneity and a way of achieving the data harmonization and integration that GIS and SDI need. This paper presents three hydrographical ontologies (which are built using top-down and bottom-up approaches) and an approach to comparing them; the goal of this approach is to prove which ontologies have a better coverage of the domain. In order to compare the resultant ontologies, six qualitative facets have been studied: sources used (amount, richness and consensus), reliability of building approaches (community extending use, recommendations), ontology richness (number and types of components), formalization (language), granularity (scale factor) and the design criteria followed.}

Web applications. However, it also introduces new issues due to the heterogeneity of the available semantic resources.
One of the most remarkable is redundancy, that is, the excess of dierent semantic descriptions, coming from dierent
sources, to describe the same intended meaning.
In this paper, we propose a technique to perform a large
scale integration of senses (expressed as ontology terms), in order to cluster the most similar ones, when indexing large amounts of online semantic information. It can dramatically reduce the redundancy problem on the current Semantic Web. In order to make this objective feasible, we have studied the adaptability and scalability of our previous work on sense integration, to be translated to the much larger scenario of the Semantic Web. Our evaluation shows a good behaviour of these techniques when used in large scale experiments, then making feasible the proposed approach.}

Ontology development has transformed from a process normally performed by one ontology engineer into a process performed collaboratively by a team of ontology engineers, who may be geographically distributed and play different roles. For example, editors may propose changes, while authoritative users approve or reject them following a well defined process. This process, however, has only been partially addressed by existing ontology development methods, methodologies, and tool support. Furthermore, in a distributed environment where ontology editors may be working on local copies of the same ontology, strategies should be in place to ensure that changes in one copy are reflected in all of them. In this paper, we propose a workflow-based model for the collaborative development of ontologies in distributed environments and describe the components required to support them. We illustrate our model with a test case in the fishery domain from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).}

Dicha red de ontolog{\'i}a se incluir{\'a} en el segundo prototipo de la plataforma Geobuddies para la recuperaci{\'o}n y edici{\'o}n de informaci{\'o}n acerca del Camino de Santiago.

3. El desarrollo de unas gu{\'i}as metodol{\'o}gicas preliminares para evitar el uso de malas pr{\'a}cticas o antipatrones durante la modelizaci{\'o}n de ontolog{\'i}as.
El modelado de ontolog{\'i}as se ha convertido por la dificultad que conlleva en uno de los principales temas de investigaci{\'o}n en el {\'a}rea de la ingenier{\'i}a ontol{\'o}gica. Adem{\'a}s, en el campo de la ingenier{\'i}a ontol{\'o}gica se ha demostrado [1, 2] que los desarrolladores de ontolog{\'i}as tienen dificultades para reutilizar patrones de dise{\~n}o correctos durante la modelizaci{\'o}n, incluyendo en estos casos errores en los modelos. Por lo tanto, se necesita un mejor soporte para entender y usar correctamente los patrones de dise{\~n}o ontol{\'o}gico, evitando de este modo la aparici{\'o}n de errores de modelado.

the different users that deal with specialized languages, from professionals of a domain to linguist experts

can be defined as: ?the linguistic discipline that deals with the combination of words?, (?), or ?the set of
phraseological units or phrasemes? of a certain specialized language. In any case, phrasemes or lexical
combinations are not only necessary for an adequate specialized communication, but they are also fundamental
in the understanding of a certain domain of knowledge, together with terms and the concepts underlying terms.}

Besides, we propose an architecture for managing context in mobile environments, including high-level descriptions of the components that compose it, as well as some low level details regarding the contextual interfaces involved. To show the way all these components interoperate and the advantages of the defined architecture and semantic model, we describe a use case with specific implementation details}

However, there is no contribution in the ontology evaluation field that proposes a method to dynamically test ontologies with regard to their functional specification. Thus, no software for this task has been built until now. This paper presents a tool, OntologyTest, designed to overcome this drawback. The tool allows the user to define a set of tests to check the ontology?s functional requirements, to execute them, and to inspect the results of the execution. The whole set of tests (or a particular test) can be executed at any time; thus it simplifies the testing of ontology both during its development and during its evolution.}

Users can assign tags freely and then use them to share and retrieve information. However, tag-based sharing and retrieval is not optimal due to the fact that tags are plain text labels without an explicit or formal meaning, and hence polysemy and synonymy should be dealt with appropriately. To ameliorate these problems, we propose a context-based tag disambiguation algorithm that selects the meaning of a tag among a set of candidate DBpedia entries, using a common information retrieval similarity measure. The most similar DBpedia en-try is selected as the one representing the meaning of the tag. We describe and analyze some preliminary results, and discuss about current challenges in this area.}

the attention of many researchers in several domains, as they can provide valuable
information about different types of relations. In this paper, the focus will be on some of these

about conceptual relations. The aim of this research is to detect recurrent patterns that express
some of the most common conceptual relations present in ontologies. The purpose of this
paper is to present the different strategies we have followed to identify LSPs which

The main problem of this integration is the great heterogeneity of data sources. The Ontology Engineering Group (OEG) is working with IGN-E to attain this objective in two phases: first, by creating automatically an ontology using the semantics of catalogues sections, and second, by discovering mappings automatically that can relate ontology concepts to database instances. So, these mappings are the instruments to break the syntactic, semantic and granularity heterogeneity gap. We have developed software for building a first ontology version and for discovering automatically mappings using techniques that take into account all types of heterogeneity. The ontology contains a set of extra-attributes which are identified in the building process. The ontology, called PhenomenOntology, will be reviewed by domain experts of IGN-E. The automatic mapping discovery will be also used for discovering new knowledge that will be added to the ontology. For increasing the usability and giving independence to different parts, the processes of each phase will be designed automatically and as upgradeable as possible.}

To solve this problem we propose LabelTranslator, a system that automatically localizes ontologies. Ontology localization consists of adapting an ontology to a concrete language and cultural community.
LabelTranslator takes as input an ontology whose labels are described in a source natural language and obtains the most probable translation into a target natural language of each ontology label. Our main contribution is the automatization of this process which reduces human efforts to localize an ontology manually. First, our system uses a translation service which obtains automatic translations of each ontology label (name of an ontology term) from/into English, German, or Spanish by consulting different linguistic resources such as lexical databases, bilingual dictionaries, and terminologies. Second, a ranking method is used to sort each ontology label according to similarity with its lexical and semantic context.
The experiments performed in order to evaluate the quality of translation show that our approach is a good approximation to automatically enrich an ontology with multilingual information.}

A step in this direction, the main contribution of the work presented in this paper is an overview of metadata and their management in the Taverna workflow system. In Taverna, we consider metadata to be a first class citizen in the system, in the sense that we fully cover their life cycle from their creation, through their use and curation until their eventual removal. We present the main steps of this cycle and present the models used for metadata specification. In doing so, we distinguish two classes of metadata: metadata that describe workflow related entities, such as services, workflows and sub- workflows, and metadata that describe workflow executions, also known as workflow provenance.}

The vast amount of freely available information allows collecting enough information about any domain. However, the Web usually suffers a lack of structure, untrustworthiness and ambiguity of the content. These drawbacks hamper the application of unsupervised methods of building ontologies demanded by the increasingly popular applications of the Semantic Web. We believe that the combination of several processing mechanisms and complementary information sources may potentially solve the problem. The analysis of different sources of evidence allows determining with greater reliability the validity of the detected knowledge. In this paper, we present GALEON (General Architecture for Learning Ontologies) that combines sources and processing resources to provide complementary and redundant evidence for making better estimations about the relevance of the extracted knowledge and their relationships. Our goal in this paper is to show how combining several information sources and extraction mechanisms is possible to build a taxonomy of concepts with a higher accuracy than if only one of them is applied. The experimental results show how this combination notably increases the precision of the obtained results with minimum user intervention.}

        abstract = {Experiments in the reuse of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have
revealed that users with different levels of expertise in ontology modelling face
difficulties when reusing ODPs. With the aim of tackling this problem we propose
a method and a tool for supporting a semi-automatic reuse of ODPs that
takes as input formulations in natural language (NL) of the domain aspect to be
modelled, and obtains as output a set of ODPs for solving the initial ontological
needs. The correspondence between ODPs and NL formulations is done
through Lexico-Syntactic Patterns, linguistic constructs that convey the semantic
relations present in ODPs, and which constitute the main contribution of this
paper. The main benefit of the proposed approach is the use of non-restricted
NL formulations in various languages for obtaining ODPs. The use of full NL
poses challenges in the disambiguation of linguistic expressions that we expect
to solve with user interaction, among other strategies.}

some words or concepts are related, considering not only similarity but any possible semantic relationship among them. Relatedness computation is of great interest in different areas, such as Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, or the Semantic Web. Different methods have been proposed in the past; however, current relatedness measures lack some desirable properties for a new generation of Semantic Web applications: maximum coverage, domain independence, and universality.
In this paper, we explore the use of a semantic relatedness measure between words, that uses the Web as knowledge source. This measure exploits the information about frequencies of use provided by existing search engines. Furthermore, taking this measure as basis, we define a new semantic relatedness measure among ontology terms. The proposed measure fulfils the above mentioned desirable properties to be used on the Semantic Web. We have tested extensively this semantic measure to show that it correlates well with human judgment, and helps solving some particular tasks, as word sense disambiguation or ontology matching.}

The access of historians and document management specialists to documentary funds and old cartography is at times arduous due to the scattering of maps throughout different map libraries. Thus, it would be of interest to be able to access all available information remotely, following the Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) guidelines. DIGMAP is a cooperative project between six European countries that proposes to develop a solution for indexing, searching and browsing, through a thesaurus, in the European collections of digitized historical maps. It will be possible to match them with the geographic areas covered by each map in the collection and to find it on them, based on standard and open data models. These results will be useful for local digital map libraries, especially if it is of historical ? cultural importance, or as interoperable components for wider and distributed systems. This project takes advantage of thesauri technologies to develop three major subsystems: On one hand, the gazetteer for managing and providing access to multilingual information relating to geographic features like geographic coordinates, names of places or areas and historical events related with the geographic points, places or areas (with dates or time intervals); The authority file to maintain and provide easy access to the author?s information and identification and disambiguating from similar and duplicate authors; and on the other hand, the map services for providing access to map information in raster and vector formats. The paper presents an early overview on the DIGMAP project, particularly focusing on the multilingual Thesauri aspects with the aim of providing solutions for the cartographic heritage framework, applying the main Spatial Data Infrastructures guidelines. ISO 19112 (Spatial Reference by Geographic Identifiers) will also be considered and its geographic identifiers issues.}

The SEEMP system presented in this paper overcomes this issue in different ways: starting bilateral communications with near-border similar offices, building a federation of the local employment services, and merging isolate trials. The SEEMP approach relies on a distributed semantic service oriented infrastructure able to federate local projects, in order to create geographically aggregated services for employment by leveraging existing local ones. The social and technical aspects of the SEEMP project are presented, showing how the SEEMP system is integrated with National level systems.}

As globalization becomes more pervasive, people all over the world need to make use of information in different languages in their everyday work. Bilingual or multilingual dictionaries have been, and still are, relevant resources for facing up multilingual issues. However, the multilingual information collected in dictionaries remains insufficient for those people who need to gain a general view of a specific parcel of knowledge in two or more languages. In LSP (Language for Specific Purposes) this issue becomes even more relevant. In the case of translation of specialized texts, specialization on source and target subject matter becomes imperative in order to get a complete understanding of the source text and transfer that knowledge to the target reader. Ontologies may come to solve this knowledge acquisition problem, since they offer a multilingual conceptualization of a specific parcel of knowledge by organizing the information according to the different and various relations between concepts. In this way, translators are able to gain the required domain knowledge, as well as the type of equivalence relations between concepts in the different languages, and their context of use. Thus, pursue of this paper is to give an overview of the benefits of multilingual ontologies to the multilingual information retrieval.}

However, the need to provide multilinguality to ontologies poses new challenges in the Ontology Engineering research. In this paper we attempt to offer an overview of available strategies for the localizing process of lexical resources and ontologies. Detailed steps in the localizing process of the multilingual lexicon EuroWordNet, the multilingual ontology GENOMA-KB, and the ontology translation software LabelTranslator are presented with the aim of illustrating three different localization approaches, their main characteristics and limitations}

a) To create specific technology for developing and composing Semantic Web Services.
b) To migrate the WebODE ontology development workbench to this new distributed
interoperable semantic service architecture.
c) To develop new semantic services (ontology learning, ontology mappings,
incremental ontology evaluation, and ontology evolution).
d) To develop technological support that eases semantic portal interoperability, using
Web services and Semantic Web Services.
The project results will be open source, so as to improve their technological transfer. The
quality of these results is ensured by a benchmarking process.

This scenario comprises a number of heterogeneous web sites containing unstructured and related, but physically decoupled, information which needs common models that provide unified ways of representing information across the different sources, i.e. ontologies. Three main milestones were defined for WEASEL: the creation of a domain ontology, the extraction of information from the different sources and its semantic annotation and aggregation, and the creation of a new web site containing a semantic search engine which provides natural interfaces for retrieving the aggregated information. WEASEL concluded with its evaluation by Vodafone.}

This layered approach makes ontology translation systems easier to build and understand, and consequently, to maintain and reuse. As part of this model, we propose a method that guides in the process of developing ontology translation systems according to this approach. The method identifies four main activities: feasibility study, analysis of source and target formats, design, and implementation of the translation system, with their decomposition in tasks, and recommends the techniques to be used inside each of them.}

The former accesses the bank accounts of a user as well as utility goods Web sites where invoicing information is stored and estimates whether the user will be in an overdraft situation in the near future, alerting him/her by e-mail or SMS. The latter accesses the mortgage information provided by the heterogeneous Web sites of different banks and allows users to compare them according to different types of criteria. The chapter not only focuses on the technological decisions followed to implement and deploy these services, but also on the added value of applying Semantic Web Services for them.}

We argue that the availability of metadata is a fundamental dimension of ontology reusability. Metadata information provides a basis for ontology developers to evaluate and adapt existing Semantic Web ontologies in new application settings, and fosters the development of support tools such as ontology repositories. However, in order for the metadata information to represent real added value to ontology users, it is equally important to achieve a common agreement on the terms used to describe ontologies, and to provide an appropriate technology infrastructure in form of tools being able to create, manage and distribute this information. In this paper we present DEMO, a framework for the development and deployment of ontology metadata. Besides OMV , the proposed core vocabulary for ontology metadata, the framework comprises an inventory of methods to collaboratively extend OMV in accordance to the requirements of an emerging community of industrial and academia users, and tools for metadata management.}

Scientific progress increasingly depends on pooling know-how and results; making connections between ideas, people, and data; and finding and reusing knowledge and resources generated by others in perhaps unintended ways. It is about harvesting and harnessing the ?collective intelligence? of the scientific community. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning to facilitate sharing and reuse, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. Applying the Semantic Web paradigm to e-Science has the potential to bring significant benefits to scientific discovery. We identify the benefits of lightweight and heavyweight approaches, based on our experiences in the Life Sciences.}

Este trabajo de investigaci{\'o}n se centra en el an{\'a}lisis metaf{\'o}rico de tres emociones negativas, la lujuria, la envidia y la ira, tres emociones incluidas en el grupo de los llamados ?pecados capitales?. El objetivo de este trabajo es describir la estructura conceptual que subyace a dichas emociones tomando como base la Teor{\'i}a Conceptual de la Met{\'a}fora, teor{\'i}a que desarrollan Lakoff y Johnson en su obra Metaphors We Live By (1980) y que ha sido de gran relevancia para el estudio del pensamiento y del lenguaje metaf{\'o}ricos (Deignan, 2005). La hip{\'o}tesis de la que parte este estudio es que las emociones negativas de la envidia, la ira y la lujuria se sustentan en met{\'a}foras expresadas mediante verbos de acci{\'o}n realizados por seres vivos o fuerzas externas. Para confirmar esta hip{\'o}tesis se parte del an{\'a}lisis ling{\"u}{\'i}stico del uso de dichas emociones en el Corpus de Referencia del Espa{\~n}ol Actual (CREA) de la Real Academia de la Lengua.}

information and services related to a specific domain, and that has
been developed with Semantic Web technology. For the time
being, the main difference with respect to a traditional Web portal
is based on technological aspects: traditional Web portals are
based on standard Web technology (HTML, XML, servlets, JSPs,
etc.); semantic portals are based on that technology plus the use of
Semantic Web languages like RDF, RDF Schema and OWL. This
paper describes a unifying architecture for both types of portals,
based on the MVC paradigm, which is implemented in the
ODESeW framework. ODESeW has been used successfully in the
development of a set of portals for the management of European
R\&D projects and for the management of research groups}

Most recently there have been some  works investigating the implications of extending Description  Logics with functional dependencies.  In particular the OWL  ontology language offers the functional property property  allowing simple functional dependency to be specified. As it  turns out, more complex FD specified as concept constructors  has been proved to lead to undecidability in the general case,  which restricts its usage as part of TBOX. This paper departs  from previous ones by restricting FDs applicability to instances  in the ABOX. We specify FD as a new constructor, an OWL  concept. FD instances are mapped to Horn clauses and evaluated  against the ABOX according to user?s desired behavior.  The  latter allows users to determine whether FDs should be  interpreted as constraints, assertions or views. Our approach  gives ontology users data guarantees usually found in databases,  integrated with the ontology conceptual model.}

        abstract = {The Grid's vision, of sharing diverse resources in a flexible, coordinated and secure manner through dynamic formation and disbanding of virtual communities, strongly depends on metadata. Currently, Grid metadata is generated and used in an ad hoc fashion, much of it buried in the Grid middleware's code libraries and database schemas. This ad hoc expression and use of metadata causes chronic dependency on human intervention during the operation of Grid machinery, leading to systems which are brittle when faced with frequent syntactic changes in resource coordination and sharing protocols. The Semantic Grid is an extension of the Grid in which rich resource metadata is exposed and handled explicitly, and shared and managed via Grid protocols. The layering of an explicit semantic infrastructure over the Grid Infrastructure potentially leads to increased interoperability and greater flexibility. In recent years, several projects have embraced the Semantic Grid vision. However, the Semantic Grid lacks a Reference Architecture or any kind of systematic framework for designing Semantic Grid components or applications. The Open Grid Service Architecture ( OGSA) aims to define a core set of capabilities and behaviours for Grid systems. We propose a Reference Architecture that extends OGSA to support the explicit handling of semantics, and defines the associated knowledge services to support a spectrum of service capabilities. Guided by a set of design principles, Semantic-OGSA ( S-OGSA) defines a model, the capabilities and the mechanisms for the Semantic Grid. We conclude by highlighting the commonalities and differences that the proposed architecture has with respect to other Grid frameworks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}

The great effort devoted in by the Semantic Web community to achieve the semantic markup of Web services (what we call Semantic Web Services) has yielded many markup technologies and initiatives, from which the Semantic Grid technology should benefit as, in recent years, it has become Web service-oriented. Keeping this fact in mind, our first premise in this work is to reuse the ODESWS Framework for the Knowledge-based markup of Grid services. Initially ODESWS was developed to enable users to annotate, design, discover and compose Semantic Web Services at the Knowledge Level. But at present, if we want to reuse it for annotating Grid services, we should carry out a detailed study of the characteristics of Web services and Grid services and thus, we will learn where they differ and why. Only when this analysis is performed should we know how to extend our theoretical framework for describing Grid services. Finally, we present the ODESGS Framework, which is the result of having applied the extensions identified to the aforementioned Semantic Web Services description framework.}

        abstract = {Ontologies have seen quite an enormous development and application in many domains within the last years, especially in the context of the next web generation, the Semantic Web. Besides the work of countless researchers across the world, industry starts developing ontologies to support their daily operative business. Currently, most ontologies exist in pure form without any additional information, e.g. authorship information, such as provided by Dublin Core for text documents. This burden makes it difficult for academia and industry e.g. to identify, find and apply ? basically meaning to reuse ? ontologies effectively and efficiently. Our contribution consists of (i) a proposal for a metadata standard, so called Ontology Metadata Vocabulary (OMV) which is based on discussions in the EU IST thematic network of excellence Knowledge Web1 and (ii) two complementary reference implementations which show the benefit of such a standard in decentralized and centralized scenarios, i.e. the Oyster P2P system and the Onthology metadata portal.}

The rule system runs on top of the open source rule engine DROOLS and is connected to the domain ontology used for annotation by means of an ad-hoc programmed Java proxy.}

As part of this model, we propose a method that guides in the process of developing ontology translation systems according to this approach. The method identifies four main activities: feasibility study, analysis of source, and target formats, design, and implementation of the translation system, with their decomposition in tasks, and recommends the techniques to be used inside each of them.}

Semantic Web Services (SWS) describe semantically the internal structure and the functional/nonfunctional capabilities of the services, facilitating the design and evaluation ofSWSs based on that semantic description of the features of the services. To enable users to design and compose SWSs at the knowledge level, the ODE SWS framework has been proposed. That framework uses problem-solving methods to describe the functional and structural features of the SWSs. In this work, we present a description of the ODE SWS environment as an implementation of the ODE SWS framework. Specially, we focus on the description of the capabilities of the SWSDesigner, the tool of the ODE SWS environment that enables users to design graphically SWSs through different but complementary views of the services.}

Indeed, such tools do not focus on detecting inconsistencies and redundancies in concept taxonomies. The second contribution is ODEval, a language-dependent tool for evaluating, from the point of view of knowledge representation, concept taxonomies in ontologies implemented in such languages.

inconsistencies among its internal components. In this
paper, we present a framework for design and (semi)
automatic composition of SWSs at a language-independent
and knowledge level. This framework is based on a stack of
ontologies that (1) describe the different parts of a SWS;
and (2) contain a set of axioms that are really design rules to be verified by the ontology instances. Based on these ontologies, design and composition of SWSs can be viewed as the correct instantiation of the ontologies themselves. Once these instances have been created they will be exported to SWS languages such as OWL-S.}

In this paper an environment for  development and description of SWSs is presented. This environment, called ODE SWSDesigner, consists of a graphical interface,  which allows users to carry out the design and  characterization of SWSs at a conceptual level,  and a set of software modules, which verify the  design correctness and perform the translations  from the graphical descriptions to the languages  used to specify SWSs. ODE SWSDesigner provides support for a layer-based framework that  we have proposed with the aim of enabling a  language -independent development of SWSs. This framework is based on the use of problemsolving methods that are considered as highlevel specifications from which SWS descriptions can be generated and verified.}

Web Services in the Semantic Web, that is, Semantic Web Services (SWS), should describe semantically their structure and capabilities to enable its automatic discovery, invocation and composition. In this work we present a development environment to design SWS in a language-independent manner. This environment is based on a framework that defines an ontology set to characterize how a SWS should be specified. The core ontology of this framework describes the SWS problem-solving behaviour and enables the SWS design at a conceptual level. Considering this framework, the SWS development environment is composed of (1) a graphical interface, in which the conceptual design of SWSs is performed, and (2) a tool set, which instantiates the framework ontologies according to the graphical model created by the user, verifies the completeness and consistency of the SWS through instance evaluation, and translates the SWS conceptual model description into SWS (and WS) languages, such as DAML-S, WSDL or UDDI. This tool set is integrated in the WebODE ontology engineering workbench in order to take advantage of its reasoning and ontology translation capabilities.}

In contrast with many existing mediator based systems, our approach rests on a three-layer knowledge representation architecture which includes an electronic services ontology besides the usual domain ontology and sources descriptions layers. At the reasoning level, we propose a new mechanism, namely dynamic discovery of e-services, that acts in collaboration with the Picsel mediator system to effectively achieve the MKBEEM mediation tasks.}

ODEClean allows cleaning taxonomies following the OntoClean method, and WebODE provides technical support to the Methontology methodology for building ontologies. We approached the development of this module in two steps. Firstly, we have integrated the OntoClean method into the conceptualisation activity of Methontology. Secondly, we have designed and implemented ODEClean using a declarative approach for specifying the knowledge to be used on the evaluation. ODEClean uses: (a) the Top Level of Universals, (b) metaproperties based on philosophical notions, and (c) OntoClean evaluation axioms. The main advantage of this approach is that the system could easily allow the user relax or stress the evaluation of the taxonomy just selecting more or less meta-properties.}

One of the more important results of the experiment presented is how the different activities to be carried out during the development of a specific ontology may involve performing other types of activities on other ontologies already built or under construction. We identify in that paper new intradependencies between activities carried out inside the same otology and interdependencies between activities carried out in different ontologies. The interrelation between life cycles of several ontologies provokes that integration has to be approached globally rather than as a mere integration of out implementation.}

In particular MKBEEM will focus on adding multilinguality to all stages of the information cycle, including multilingual content generation and maintenance, automated translation and interpretation and enhancing the natural interactivity and usability of the service with unconstrained language input. On the Knowledge engineering side, the MKBEEM Ontologies will provide a consensual representation of the electronic commerce field in three typical Domains (Tourism, Mail order, Retailers) allowing the exchanges independently of the language of the end user, the service, or the content provider. Ontologies will be used for classifying and indexing catalogues, for filtering user?s query, for facilitating multilingual man-machine dialogues between user and software agent, and for inferring information that is relevant to the user?s request. This paper concentrates on ontology issues, while the used human language processing approaches will be presented closely in our later papers.}

process, composed of three activities: analysis, synthesis and holistic testing. A proposed instantiation of this framework for the process of conceptualisation in knowledge-based systems (KBS) construction is then presented. The paper focuses on an activity that is frequently overlooked in conceptualisation, that is, holistic testing, and on a technique that is proposed to address this phase, known as the knowledge map (KM). This technique integrates the static and dynamic perspectives of the reasoning employed by the expert to solve the problem. This paper discusses the foundations and an application of this technique.}

However, mainly due to the fact that Ontological Engineering is still a relatively immature discipline, each work group employs its own methodology. Our goal is to present the most representative methodologies used in ontology development and to perform an analysis of such methodologies against the same framework of reference. So, the goal of this paper is not to provide new insights about methodologies, but to put it all in one place and help people to select which methodology to use.}

and transforming a conceptual model of an existing and implemented ontology into a new, more correct and more complete conceptual model which is reimplemented. Three activities have been identified in this process: reverse engineering, restructuring and forward engineering. The aim of Reverse Engineering is to output a possible conceptual model on the basis of the code in which the ontology is implemented. The goal of Restructuring is to reorganize this initial conceptual model into a new conceptual model, which is built bearing in mind the use of the restructured ontology by the ontology/application that reuses it. Finally, the objective of Forward Engineering is output a new implementation of the ontology. The paper also discusses how the ontological reengineering process has been applied to the Standard-Units ontology [18], which is included in a Chemical-Elements [12] ontology. These two ontologies will be included in a Monatomic-Ions and Environmental-Pollutants ontologies.}

The first day was devoted to paper presentations and discussions. The second (half) day, a joint session was held with two other workshops: (1) Building, Maintaining, and Using Organizational Memories and (2) Intelligent Information Integration. The reason for the joint session was that in all three workshops, ontologies play a prominent role, and the goal was to bring together researchers working on related issues in different communities. The workshop ended with a discussion about the added value of a combined ontologies-PSM workshop compared to separate workshops.}

For this purpose the following steps have been taken: (a) an ontology in the chemicals domain developed under the METHONTOLOGY framework and the Ontology Design Environment (ODE) has been taken as knowledge source; (b) the linguistic ontology GUM (Generalized Upper Model) used in other languages has been extended and modified for Spanish; (c) a Spanish grammar has been built following the systemic-functional model by using the KPML (Komet-Penman Multilingual) environment. As result, the final system named Ontogeneration permits the user to consult and retrieve all the information of the ontology in Spanish.}

ODE allows developers to specify their ontology by filling in tables and drawing graphs.

and knowledge reuse in the games domain. In spite of the
need to find a good evaluation function, search algorithms
and interface design can be said to be the primary concerns.
In addition, we will discuss the current state of the main
statistical learning methods and how they can be addressed
from a software engineering point of view. So, this paper
proposes a reliable environment and adequate tools, necessary in order to achieve high levels of reuse in the games domain.}

given domain and organize it in a shared and consensuated conceptual model, we recommend
an approach that integrates the following intermediate representation techniques: Data
Dictionary, Concepts Classification Trees, Tables of Instance Attributes, Table of Class
Attributes, Table of Constants, Tables of Formulas, Attributes Classification Trees, and
Tables of Instances. We also provide a set of guidelines to verify the knowledge gathered
inside each intermediate representations and between intermediate representations.}

point of departure in the search for the best ontology for

After briefly exploring some general questions such as: why, what, when, how and where to evaluate; who evaluates; and, what to evaluate against, we focus on the definition of a set of criteria useful in the evaluation process. Finally, we use some of these criteria in the evaluation of the Bibliographic-Data [5] ontology.}

The idea is to learn from Knowledge Base Systems' evaluation and assessment by picking up some successful ideas and adapting them to the domain of the ontologies.

The paper also describes how different agents that use ontologies with different aims have different concerns in the evaluation and assessment processes.
